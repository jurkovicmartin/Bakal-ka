## Notes
- information = detected (electrical signal after mapping to modulation)

# Include
- include parameters for modulators and recievers
- image of communication chain above the buttons
- parameters limits
- Finish remaining ideal blocks
- general parameters (Fs, ..)
- (value of carrier power)
- (different showing PAM real, PSK magnitude + phase, QAM real + imaginary)
- show signal before detection (end of channel)

# Debug
- signal_power warning (divide by zero)
- constellations (kinda fixed)
- displaying signals in time (display modul)(not better)
- look at whole communication

# Big
- WDM
- polarization multiplexing
- presets

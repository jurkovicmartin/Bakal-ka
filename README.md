## Notes
- information = detected (electrical signal after mapping to modulation)
- instead of data quantity try setting transmission speed (based on that and bits/symbols (modulation) it will callculate Rs)

- Parameters (popsat vliv)

# 1
- Effect of laser frequency, linewidth
- Effect of photodiode bandwidth
- signal power with modulators
- data quantity lack of memory (memory usage) (speed input)
- limits
- no need for bits (Tx, Rx)
- my Laser (no Linewidth)
- transmission speed set by Rs -> calculation by symbol rate (symbols/s) and modulation format (know how many bits on symbol)

# 2
- constellations (kinda fixed)
- general parameter SpS combobox
- (eyediagram show only for some modulations)
- signal_power warning (divide by zero)
- huge attenuation (not aply)
- source huge noises (bordel)
- dont allow shit states
- my PM
- presets / config
- narocnost simulace (combobox with SpS + data quantity selection)

# Include
- image of communication chain above the buttons

# BIG
- WDM
- OFDM
- polarization multiplexing
- FEC
- presets

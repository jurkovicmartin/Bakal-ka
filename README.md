## Notes
- information = detected (electrical signal after mapping to modulation)

# Include
- include parameters for modulators and recievers
- image of communication chain above the buttons
- parameters limits
- Ideal reciever / ideal modulator
- general parameters (Fs, ..)
- (value of carrier power)
- (mby try showing bits as information)
- (eyediagram show only for some modulations)

# Debug
- signal_power warning (divide by zero)
- constellations (kinda fixed)
- reciever bandwidth (0)
- Effect of laser frequency, linewidth
- Effect of photodiode bandwidth
- information restoration
- signal power with modulators
- reciever (citlivost), ...

# BIG
- WDM
- OFDM
- polarization multiplexing
- FEC
- presets
